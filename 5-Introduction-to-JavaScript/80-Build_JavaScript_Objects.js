// Learned about objects and their similarities to arrays. You access the information in an object via properties and allow for structured data storage

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Cory",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["People food", "Belly rubbins"]



};
