# TG-Pre-Work

### While we do want our developers to work smarter, not harder, please refrain from plagiarizing.  It is completely fine to reword information you have gleaned from internet sources, however, please be prepared to redo the work should you submit a directly copied/pasted answer.  If you must copy/paste, cite your sources (this citation doesn't need to be fancy - just state directly where you found the information or provide a link).  Additionally, some of the questions below are tricky.  The answers were not necessarily covered in the reading we assigned.  They are not intended to be straightforward because we expect you to do some research to discover the answers to the best of your ability.  If you cannot find an answer, explain what you do know and what you are stuck on.  

## When we hit https://www.techtonic.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions in general terms/steps.

The client (your computer) checks with the server it believes the URL is located at. The server checks to see if that domain is hosted on it. If it is, then your website will pull up, if not, then the server will send out requests to other server to see if it can find where the URL you want is located. Once it finds the host server, the first server saves the URL location in it's memory incase another client wants to know where that URL is hosted. This prevents the first server from having to ask around again.
